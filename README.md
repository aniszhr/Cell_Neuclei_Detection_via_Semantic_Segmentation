# Cell_Neuclei_Detection_via_Semantic_Segmentation
 
## 1. Summary
<p>The objective of this project is to train a model that is able to detect cell nuclei from biomedical images. Due to various shapes and sizes in the nuclei, semantic segmentation is suitable to be selected to detect them. <br>

The model is trained with [Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018). </p>

## 2. IDE and Framework
<p>The project is built with Spyder as the main IDE. The main frameworks used in this project are TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV and Scikit-learn.</p>
